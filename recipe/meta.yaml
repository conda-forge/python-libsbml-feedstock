  description: |
    LibSBML is an application programming interface library for
    reading, writing, manipulating and validating content
    expressed in the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML)
    format.

    It is written in ISO C and C++, provides language bindings
    for Common Lisp, Java, Python, Perl, MATLAB and Octave, and
    includes many features that facilitate adoption and use of
    both SBML and the library. Developers can embed libSBML in
    their applications, saving themselves the work of
    implementing their own SBML parsing, manipulation and
    validation software.
